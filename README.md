# gigs
Tiny app to find what gigs are on near you tonight.

#### Version 1

was a mess of jQuery made a few years ago in 45 mins when I thought of the idea.

#### Version 2

At https://gigsnearme.com is 6.8kb gzipped kept small using system fonts and ES6 Javascript bundled using RollupJS

It fetches gigs within a certain radius, then displays them at random as you click 'shuffle'
