# gigs
Tiny app to find what gigs are on near you tonight.

#### Version 1

was a mess of jQuery made a few years ago in 45 mins when I thought of the idea.

#### Version 2

is less than 40k (20k gzipped) kept small using system fonts, inlined CSS to head, and ES6 Javascript bundled using RollupJS.

#### Version 3

is the equivalent in ES5 without modern module bundling or syntax, just to see how much bundle size can effect small JS applications. In this case the modern ES6 + Rollup build is NUMx the older syntax. Worth noting this is VERY simple.
